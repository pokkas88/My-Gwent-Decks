Another Renfri deck, cause.. lets face it.. Renfri will play in all decks these first few weeks. This time though, Renfri is used in conjunction with Mobilization. Master sensei Decode created another masterpiece with an archtype that is not often seen on ladder.

Considerations: This deck is an absolute beast if your engines are allowed to stick on board. As many of the current decks play without any form of punishment, you can expect to get maximum value from cards like the Arbalest. The more efficiently you play, taking advantage of all the synergies, the more damage you ll be able to make. Against most decks, you will obliterate most engines your opponent will try to place on baord. Eldibald is a weird option here, I personally dislike the 3 turn cooldown, while fiddling around with the card though i realized that if played right it can help squeeze out more points of damage without actually commiting your charges from your removal engines. This is a highly efficient deck in terms of control!
