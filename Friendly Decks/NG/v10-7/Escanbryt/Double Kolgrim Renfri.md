A creation from another master of the kind, Escanbryt took the well proven (and already annoying to play against) clog with Kolgrim and added that extra spice with the new Renfri card

![Double Clog Renfri](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108788898/177608955-eec0999a-02dd-4dfc-9ca6-2e145b330a30.JPG)

Considerations: Deck follows same strategy as a normal clog deck, be as greedy as possible and push. A suggestion would be to bleed Round 2 with Kolgrim but if possible and depending on the match up keep Renfri for the very short Round 3. If opponent has no answer for the Kolgrims, you will 2-0. If they do have a reply for the Kolgrims, Renfri in a short Round 3 is devastating. Runemage is a card that can be added here if you wish some more consistency from Renfri's options
