Boy oh boy, the master memer Bomblin has done it again. An amazing deck with a lot of value coming from Renfri and of course Cahir. In this new meta we see a lot of decks going tall with multiple boosts, Cahir makes your opponents insta forfeit cause most of those decks lacks any form of removal or reset

Considerations: I wouldnt touch anything on this deck, other than maybe some of the soldier options depending on your playstyle. All in all a very solid deck!
